# guacamole-scripts

The scripts can be used for any guacamole installation.

Just use wget to download the script and make changes to meet your environment.

Usage:
 
step 1. wget [link to script]

step 2. Open the script and set dest=/backup to be the absolute path of your backup location e.g dest=/backups/guacamole.

step 3. chmod +x [script name]

step 4. sudo sh [script name]

Thank you.
